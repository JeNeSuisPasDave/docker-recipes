# Docker Recipes

This is a collection of recipes for Docker containers, along with a few utilities to support the use of Docker on OS X and Windows 10.

## Status

Right now these are all very preliminary. This is mostly a record of my experiments learning to provision and manage Docker containers.

There are many hardcoded references to items specific to my personal development system. Eventually I hope to remove those and make the scripts and utilities usesful without modification on any system.
